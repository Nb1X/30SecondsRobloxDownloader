‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:
Do not close the Roblox installer window or the terminal window while the installation is running! Closing them may corrupt the Roblox installation, and you will need to rerun the script to reinstall Roblox properly.

If Roblox opens after the installation, please do not close the application. Our software will automatically close it for you.

üî• This program fully complies with Roblox‚Äôs terms of use by installing an official version (not pirated) directly from Roblox‚Äôs servers.

If you get banned, it is most likely not caused by 30SecondsRobloxInstaller, but rather because of one of the following reasons:

Using unauthorized mods,

Modifying Roblox Player or Studio files,

Having malware on your computer that alters Roblox files,

Or any other intentional actions that violate Roblox‚Äôs rules.

üö´ Do NOT download this software unless it comes from one of these official sources:

GitHub (this repository)

Mega (official link available on our Discord)

If you find this software on other platforms like MediaFire, Gofile, Google Drive, etc., it is likely a fake or Trojan pretending to be our software.
